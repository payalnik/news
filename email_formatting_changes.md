## Changes Made

The following improvements have been made to the email formatting in the News Updater application:

1. **HTML Email Format**
   - Emails are now sent in both HTML and plain text formats
   - HTML emails have proper styling with CSS for better readability
   - Responsive layout with proper headings, paragraphs, and sections

2. **Source Links for News Stories**
   - Each news section now includes links to the original sources
   - Sources are displayed with their domain names for cleaner appearance
   - Links open in a new tab when clicked

3. **Improved Text Formatting**
   - Better paragraph structure for improved readability
   - Proper HTML list formatting with <ul> and <li> tags
   - Automatic conversion of markdown-style lists (- or *) to HTML lists
   - Consistent styling throughout the email
   - Added footer section

## Technical Implementation

- Updated `send_news_update` function in `news_updater/news_app/tasks.py`
- Changed from `send_mail` to `EmailMultiAlternatives` to support both HTML and plain text
- Added HTML structure with CSS styling
- Improved the Claude prompt to request HTML formatting in summaries
- Added automatic detection and conversion of markdown-style lists to HTML lists
- Added source links section for each news category

## Testing the Changes

A test script has been created to verify the email formatting changes:

```bash
python test_email_format.py your.email@example.com
```

This script will send a test email with sample news sections to the specified email address. The email will demonstrate:

- The new HTML formatting
- Source links for each news section
- Both plain text and HTML versions of the email

## Example Email Preview

### HTML Version

The HTML email includes:

- A header with the date
- Personalized greeting
- News sections with proper headings
- Source links for each section
- Consistent styling throughout
- A footer section

### Plain Text Version

For email clients that don't support HTML, a plain text version is also included with:

- Clear section headings using markdown-style formatting
- Readable paragraphs
- Full URLs for sources
- Simple, clean layout

## Next Steps

1. Monitor email delivery and open rates to ensure the new format is working correctly
2. Gather user feedback on the new email format
3. Consider additional improvements such as:
   - Adding images for news stories
   - Including more metadata about sources
   - Customizing email appearance based on user preferences
